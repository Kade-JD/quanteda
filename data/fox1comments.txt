The fact that this officer worked for 6 different departments in 4 years tells us there were problems well before this incident. It's incredibly common for an officer to just get hired onto a different police department whenever they get into trouble with their current department.

This cop is going away for a very long time and rightfully so. There is no justification for the cop. I generally back the blue, but I donâ€™t do so blindly. They had time and distance on their side. Anyone saying otherwise couldnâ€™t have seen the video.

Cop was short tempered from the start.  He had no business being LEO.  She didn't deserve being shot.  I watched the video several times and so no justification in his actions.
