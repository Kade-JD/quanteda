There will be a wrongful death lawsuit as well, and looks like the plaintiffs will have a wide open slam dunk. If cops’ paychecks had specific deductions to help pay for these, on graduated terms with the chief paying the most, then they might think twice about the blue wall of silence.

This deputy worked for 6 police departments in the last two years, according to reporting from NPR. Long list of problems. Why can't police departments check an applicant's background properly? Maybe they did, and hired him anyway, I don't know. This is horrible, but at least this deputy was immediately charged with murder.

“Until we get justice for Sonya Massey, we rebuke this discriminatory criminal justice system in the name of Jesus,” Mr. Crump said. Is it clear to Mr. Crump whom he is representing? Does Mr. Grayson believe that Ms. Massey's "Rebuke in the name of Jesus" put his life in danger and thus justified deadly force? Are the people involved in this incident rational beings?

I literally cried after seeing that footage. This was a cold blooded murder. Akin to the execution stories around kill squads of depraved regimes of terror. There is no harsh enough penalty for such a heinous and inhuman action. I mourn for Sonya Massey's family. She was treated worse than an animal, like her life had absolutely no value. But clearly Ms.Massey was an intelligent, soft spoken and beautiful woman whose worse mistake in life was in trusting 2 men who were sworn to protect her. Outrageous.

The ongoing calls to end qualified immunity, i.e., "De-Fang the Police," become stridently relevant each time police officers fatally shoot unarmed citizens, claiming the victims, disproportionately citizens of color, posed a threat to officers' person. I strongly believe that U. S. citizens have a right to feel safe. This right derives from the psychological necessity that the sense of personal safety is a prerequisite of individuals' pursuit of happiness (e.g., see, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs). Khalil Gibran's insight "A hungry man hears a song with his stomach!" nicely capture my point here. The DOJ's empirical data on police shootings of unarmed citizens suggest that qualified immunity might threaten both public safety and, more to my point, the personal safety of historically marginalized citizens, the need to end the policy has become more immediate. I can only speculate as to whether a successful De-Fang the Police campaign would have saved Ms. Massey, but doing so could save some of the thousands of unarmed citizens that police will kill in the future and restore the sense of safety.

Multiple media reports describe this encounter wrongly. There was no “dispute over a pot of water” or “chaotic scene” at the moment that Grayson murdered Ms. Massey. It was a bolt from the blue. Until the moment Grayson freaked out and drew his gun, there was nothing but a perfunctory police follow up on a 911 call reporting a suspected intruder heard outside of a home. Yes, Ms. Massey was odd. Her running asides to God and her confusion with questions made it clear she had a nervous condition and/or mental impairment. But there was nothing about her that was the least bit threatening. From the start, Officer Grayson was hyped up, aggressive, and combative—in contrast to his much calmer partner. He appeared to have zero comprehension of how to deal with someone who is emotionally impaired. Both officers should have realized that Ms. Massey needed to connect with a caring friend or family member or mental healthcare provider. If none of those were available, they should have had enough training to do some active sympathetic listening and make a referral to a social agency for a follow-up visit. It is horrifying to see such brutal, senseless death. If you're a police officer, and you're working with a colleague who is as aggressive and tone deaf as Officer Grayson, please report him or her right away. Any officer who behaves like that brings shame to the whole profession of policing.

@David L. Well, David, let's start with the fact that a large percentage of those hired for positions in law enforcement are culled from the ranks of military veterans. Now, if those vets had received some sort of deprogramming upon their return from combat, it might be one thing. However, to the best of my knowledge, no such transitioning takes place. Makes sense, right? Spend weeks if not months training people to become remorseless killers, ship them to the farthest corners of earth to slaughter nameless, faceless victims, then welcome them back to civil (sometimes) society to blend right in. So then it only makes sense to recruit these individuals to enroll at the police academy. Kind of turns that old watchword to "serve and protect" on its head, does it not?

There is something very wrong with us when we see police officers murdering unarmed people every other day with impunity. Of course, the pot of water is a “threat” and he will walk and get away with murder. Our murder rate, murder clearance rate, killing by police rate, and gun violence rate are all amongst the highest in the developed world, much higher than many “third world” countries with no “freedom.”

Where was the threat? This is murder by an angry man who made good on his threat to shoot her in the face. A murderer who has no place walking the streets, let alone carrying a gun.

The footage is horrific to watch, but I want to also add what the article didn't mention, which is how the county sheriff's department maintained echoing silence on the matter for several days afterwards, instead of arresting the officer once they heard what happened and saw the footage. People are mad that it happened, but they're also mad about how it was handled. For days afterwards, people were calling and protesting for more information about why she had died, but first it was reported by the county as a possible self-inflicted wound. They knew better. They should have done better.

The body camera footage is horrific and will put this police officer away for a long time. But watching it, it occurred to me that there must have been thousands of similar incidents over the years that were swept under the rug because there was no video evidence. The shooter just had to say, "I felt threatened," and of course his partner would support him, and we would take the cops at their word. I am not anti law and order, but such behavior has to stop. Hopefully, body cameras provide us with the impetus and the evidence to demand change in how law enforcement officers serve and protect us.

Bad apples sometimes slip thru a hiring process and unfortunately they treat other humans as their shooting gallery .

The officer should be in jail. The police department should have to pay HUGE damages to family. It appears that nothing has been done to stop this sort of police brutality and murder. Qualified immunity for police has to end. Every police officer should be required to carry malpractice insurance. An officer who cannot obtain insurance should not be able to work. That would surely have a good impact on this situation.

I watched the body cam footage. Sean Grayson committed first degree murder, no doubt about it. She was standing far away from him, more than several feet, and he clearly became enraged when she rebuked him. She posed no threat to him at that distance, and probably no threat at all - the officers had told her to remove the pot of water from the stove. He shot her in anger, and it is unfathomable and distressing to watch. I hope he's given the harshest punishment possible.

I've seen two different lengths of the video. The first one has her answering the door and the officer asking why it took her so long to open the door. She replied that she had to put some cloths on. Then she seems a little confused as she sat on the couch. She was looking at some paperwork and the officer asked her name; it took her a second too long to say her last name and the officer is clearly more aggravated. Then he rudely tells her to take the water off the stove. As she does so, that's when she rebukes him. His reply was again, very aggressive. He actually told her that she better not because he'd shoot her. Then she's on the floor over by the stove and he is on the other side of a counter. (She is visible to him but not his camera due to the counter). From that point he starts yelling at her to stop doing what she's doing and almost immediately shoots her in the face. How in the world was she a threat when she's on the floor on one side of the counter and he's standing on the other side of the counter? When his partner says he's going to get the kit (medical kit) the officer basically, says no need, it's a face shot as you can see. It has been reported that this officer has had 6 different jobs since 2020. He's probably been overly aggressive at his other jobs and that's why he had been let go so many times. I believe he's been itching to do this to someone for some time now.

Why are we paying taxes for a government operation we can’t use? The rampant LE failures across this country are unacceptable. This case won’t get the interrogations that happened at Congress yesterday but it should, as should all the others. People of all SECs, ages, races and gender are telling me they no longer call the police for anything. Yet salaries and pensions for police are sky high and we keep funding more and more. In my town we have pot holes the size of kiddie pools and zero services because 80% of our budget goes to police and sheriff who we can’t call because they are incompetent at best. Our town just spent $100 million on new war equipment for police. I don’t trust them to use it appropriately and not kill taxpayers. It’s an election year, we can make change. Not wild and extreme moves, but meaningful and effective policy change that starts with 100% pension loss and permanent barring from LE of any kind if they are found to have had issues.

The question for the jury will be: can boiling water incapacitate a law enforcement officer to a place they are now in danger of great harm or death? Scenario: if a contacted person takes your pepper spray and uses it against you, blinding/burning you so you are unable to protect yourself, a place were they can take your gun, get a knife, or a club, or push you down a flight stairs, deadly force can be used to protect oneself. This woman called the police, and when contacted she held boiling water as a threat, refusing to put it down, and the officers reacted (legally or not)? Were they in threat of harm which could have led to there death justifying deadly force in that instant.

She was on the couch, looking for documents/her ID in a purse, and officer Grayson instructed her to attend to the pot on her stove because he was concerned it was a fire hazard. She went to the sink to drain the pot, and made what was clearly intended as a lighthearted remark, which was completely misinterpreted by the officer, who was a safe distance away from her, even if he did misconstrue the actions that she was taking (which, again, were in response to his explicit request) as threatening.

I did not read she sat on sofa looking for paper, then got up and went to stove to turn it off. This is for a court to determine based on law, but the question will be, if she threatened police with boiling water, is that sufficient to fear great bodily injury or death resulting from incapacitation.

@Maxb Not true. The lady called police because she thought there was an intruder. Upon having the police come to her door, she invited them in, followed their commands sat on her sofa and answered their questions as best she could. It became apparent to the police officer that he was not dealing with a mentally competent person. Instead of calling an ambulance to evaluate her, or simply leaving after telling her that there is no intruder, he then inexplicably tells her to go ahead and remove a pot of boiling water from the stove. He is in a different room on the other side of a counter at least 15 feet away from her, i.e., way out of harms way, as she mumbles something about rebuking him in the name of Jesus Christ. He takes offence and then pulls out his gun pointing at her head yells at her to drop the pot of boiling water (which would presumably seriously burn her had she complied) and when she ducks down, he approaches her and shoots her after she's already ducking. He's still at least 6 feet away from her as he rounds the counter and shoots her for no reason. At no time does she threaten him with the pot of water or make any motion indicating that she was about to throw it at him (as if she could reach him from 20 feet away and over a counter if she tried) There is no justification for this lady to be dead at the hands of this man.

Where are the all the comments on this outrageous crime? What is happening to us that we numb to a police officer killing a citizen with little thought and caring? We are in a world of trouble, as we become more and more divorced from this type of brute reality. In the right move, at least this officer was fired and not put on administrative leave with pay. Dear God.

@Scrumpie0 My guess is because it was buried under the 47 political articles and has already been moved off the page.

Unbelievable! A shot in the head! In other countries a response to a thread from a person without handgun would be a shot in the foot. Look at Germany where recently an axe-swinging man in a public crowd was disarmed by such a move.

What a badly reported article! Why not mention that the officer instructed Ms. Massey to remove the pot from the stove? You mention the remark about Jesus, but not the moment Ms. Massey said "I'm sorry" or ducked from the gun before she was shot? I urge everyone reading this to go watch the video for yourselves. This was 10x worse than this piece describes!

@Amani Right! The only reason she even picked up the pot is because he told her to.

@Amani You are correct. The cop that shot her told her to take care of the pot. She took the pot from the stove and walked towards the sink. There was nothing threatening. She asked why he was going, he said away from her hot steaming water. The said "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus", I think it was a joke and she was eccentric. But not threatening in any way. He pulls out his gun and she seem scared and confused why he is doing that, saying she is sorry and cowering down to the floor. Then he shot her in the head. That cop is a monster, it is scary that people like that are on the police force.

There are reports that the shooter worked for 6 law enforcement agencies since 2020. Investigators should determine why, since it is known that law enforcement agencies routinely fail to report disciplinary and other issues of former employees from a stated fear of lawsuits. As long as such records are accurate, governmental immunity should prevent such an abuse of the courts.

@John Walker That is called a Gypsy Cop. It happens thousands of times a year. An officer screws up badly, and because of union and contract stipulations, he/she has the opportunity to quit before being fired. All too many cities just take the vagrant in without asking why. Only the internet news had slowed this down.

@John Walker Can almost smell the testosterone watching the video. Macho boys should have spent more time in training than in the parlor getting tribal tattoos. Another example of the worst of humanity high on power. Hope he enjoys his time in prison.
