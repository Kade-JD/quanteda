Comply first, complain second. Why would you make any sudden movement and then duck behind a counter?  There is tension in every call, so why not just do what the officer asks. It was a reasonable request.

Prayers to her family.

Obviously none of us were there. I feel so sorry for this lady's family. However, based on this story alone, I'd say to anyone, follow the officer's orders. Maybe, just maybe if she'd put down the pot things would've ended differently

He was arrested, fired, charged, and will stand trial, if convicted he will spend, likely the rest of his life in prison, where he will surely die, as an incarcerated cop.
Let’s see how his trial goes.

Why do black people when confronted by a police officer have to argue with the officer.

WoW sounds like an extremely difficult incident, which by no means should have resulted in the death of anyone.  If no one was located, officers should have checked the area and reported GOA (Gone on Arrival) and left.  What transpired after that is both confessing and disturbing!
